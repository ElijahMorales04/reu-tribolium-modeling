# 🪲 Tribolium Beetle Dispersal Modeling – NSF REU @ ASU

This repository contains simulation notebooks and mathematical models from my research as a Quantitative Research Assistant in the **NSF QRLSSP REU** at Arizona State University (Summer 2024). We analyzed **dispersal evolution and population dynamics** in *Tribolium castaneum* beetles using mathematical biology techniques.
